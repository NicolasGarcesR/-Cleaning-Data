The data in the run_analysis.R scirpt is downloaded from the UCI HAR Dataset folder

The raw data is the following, all of them comes in text format:
- features: Raw signals from the accelerometer.
- activities : Group of activities prerformed by the tested people.
- subject_test: data from the tested people, in the test group.
- subject_train: data from the tested people, in the train group.
- x_tests: recorded features from the tested data.
- y_tests: labels from the x_test activities.
- x_train: recorded features from the train data.
- y_train: labels from the x_train activities.
    
then, it was procesed in 3 datasets: 
- x: the combination of the x_tests and x_train dataset.
- y: the combination of the y_tests and y_train dataset.
- Subjec:  the combination of the subjec_tests and subjec_train dataset.
  
and finally merged into the "Data" dataset.

the "data_2" dataset is the "Data" dataset processed in this order:

1.Takes the observations that contain the mean and standar deviation.
2.Names the activities in the datasets.
3.Labels the dataset with descriptive variable names.

- "Data_3": takes the mean and standar deviation by subject and activity from the "data_2" dataset
